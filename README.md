# Advent of Code

_Advent of Code_ is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), [interview](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/)  [prep](https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home)  [coursework](https://www.gribblelab.org/scicomp2019/), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584)  [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

This project contains my advent of code solutions of 2021 written in Ruby. As this was my first time working in Ruby, I'm certain the solutions can be improved upon a lot.
